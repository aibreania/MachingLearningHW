Q1: This is not really a question but an exercise. Type in "demo(grapics)" in the R console and then run through the various cases to understand how to plot different types of graphs. 
> demo(graphics)

Q2: Open the file "mountains.txt" in excel or in a flat file editor and take a look at it. Then read it into a dataframe in R. How many rows and columns does the dataframe have? (All data files for the course are in the DSTMAA_data folder.)
> data = read.table("Downloads/ML/mountains.txt", header = TRUE)
> m = length(data)
> n = length(data[,1])
> print(c("Number of rows = ",n))
[1] "Number of rows = " "35"
> print(c("Number of columns = ",m))
[1] "Number of columns = " "3"

Q3: Write an expression that gives the column names. 
> print(names(data))
[1] "dist"  "climb" "time" 

Q4: Show scatter plots for each pair of variables. Eyeballing your plots, is the correlation between the pairs of variables positive or negative? 
> dist = data$dist
> climb = data$climb
> time = data$time
> plot(dist, climb, xlab="dist", ylab="climb")
> abline(lm(climb ~ dist))
> plot(climb, time, xlab="Climb", ylab="Time")
> abline(lm(time ~ climb))
> plot(dist, time, xlab="Dist", ylab="Time")
> abline(lm(time ~ dist))
Positive

Q5: Check your intuition from Q4 by running the correlation table for the variables in your data set. 
> rets = as.data.frame(cbind(data$dist,data$climb,data$time))
> names(rets) = c("Dist", "Climb", "Time")
> print(cov(rets))
 Dist     Climb      Time
Dist  1.0000000 0.6523461 0.9195892
Climb 0.6523461 1.0000000 0.8052392
Time  0.9195892 0.8052392 1.0000000

Q6: How will you create a vector of all the mountain names in the data set?
> data = setNames(cbind(rownames(data), data, row.names = NULL), 
+          c("Mountains","dist","climb", "time"))
> print(head(data2))
     Mountains dist climb   time

2     Carnethy  6.0  2500 48.350

5   Ben Lomond  8.0  3070 62.267

[1] "<p>One of the basic principles of Taoism is P'U; the Uncarved Block. The essence of the Uncarved Block is that things in their original simplicity contain their own natural power, power that is easily spoiled and lost when that simplicity is changed. This principle applies not only to things, but to people as well. Or Bears. Which brings us to Pooh, the very Epitome of the Uncarved Block. When you discard arrogance, complexity, and a few, other things that get in the way, sooner or later you will discover that simple, childlike, and mysterious secret known to those of the Uncarved Block: Life is Fun. Along with that comes the ability to do things spontaneously and have them work, odd as that may appear to others at times. As <a href=\"/piglet.html\">Piglet</a> put it in 'Winnie-the-Pooh', \"Pooh hasn't much Brain, but he never comes to any harm. He does silly things and they turn out right.\"</p>"
